# Dockerfile responsible to build the image for the wordpress container
# we need to set up additional components manually, such as a web server (Apache or Nginx) and PHP,
# because the debian:bullseye image doesn't include these by default.

# speficies the base image for the Docker image - Debian with the Bullseye release (which is the one previous to the latest stable version)
# it sets up the starting point for building the Docker image (Debian 11)
# base image is needed because it provides the foundational environment upon which the custom Docker image will be built - OS, software packages, libraries and tools; docker images are built in layers and the base image is the initial layer
# provides a stable and mininal Debian environment; we won't setup the web server part, it will be handled by the nginx
FROM    debian:bullseye

# informs Docker that the container will be listening on port 9000 at runtime
# the word EXPOSE doesn't publish the port, it only indicates which ports are intended to be published
# allows services running inside the container to be accessible outside of it (such as the PHP-FPM)
# informs docker compose about the ports that need to be connected between containers
EXPOSE	9000

# defines a build-time variables which set the version and path to the PHP-FPM configuration directory
ARG		PHP_VERSION=7.4
ARG		PHPPATH=/etc/php/${PHP_VERSION}/fpm

# Installation of the necessary packages: PHP and its dependencies 
# apt update: updates the package index inside the Docker image - ensures latest version of the packages
# apt install -y ..: installs the specified server packages without recommended or suggested packages
# ca-certificates: adds Certificate Authority (CA) certificates to verify SSL connections;
# this package manages SSL certificates and is a good practice to have it installed
# php7.4-fm: installs PHP-FPM 7.4, which is essential for serving PHP files and running PHP applications like Wordpress
# php7.4-mysql: installs PHP MySQL module for database connectivity, to support PHP, allowing it yo communicate with MySQL databases. It is necessary for WordPress to interact with MariaDB
# wget: installs wget, a tool for downloading files from the web via HTTP, HTTPS and FTP protocols. In this Dockerfile it's used to download WordPress and potentially other resources
# tar: installs tar (Tape Archive), a tool for extracting and creating tar archives for files. In this Dockerfile it;t used to extract the downloaded WordPress archive (latest.tar.gz)
# rm -rf ...: cleans up the package cache to reduce the image size
# apt-get clean: removes all cached .deb packages from the local rep cache

# FPM = FastCGI Process Manager;
# CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard protocol that defines how web servers communicate with external programs or scripts to generate dynamic web content or perform other server-side tasks.
# FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation that offers several advantages over and more efficiency then traditional CGI-based methods

# Ensures that required directories exist for PHP-FPM and WordPress operations and changes its owner to www-data user, ensuring that WordPress files can be read and written by the PHP-FPM process securely.

# --nodaemonize: tells php-fpm7.4 to run in the foreground rather than as a background daemon (common practice, allows the container to stay alive as long as the main process is running; when the main process runs in the foreground, Docker can manage the container lifecycle based on the status of that process; if the process stops, the container will stop)
